1. What are Constructors and Destructors?
Constructors are used for instantiating objects. In python this is the `__init__()` method and it is called at the creation of an object.

The two types of constructors are:
+ default: The default constructor takes no arguments while initializing the object of a specific class. Its definition has only one argument which is a reference to the instance being constructed.
+ parameterized: The parameterized constructor takes arguments to initialize the object of a specific class. The parameterized constructor takes its first argument as a reference to the instance being constructed known as self and the rest of the arguments are provided by the programmer.

2. What do you understand about the Copy Constructor in OOPS?
What are subclasses and superclasses in OOPS?
What is Hybrid Inheritance in OOPS?
Differentiate between the different types of Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming
What are the main advantages of Data Abstraction in OOPS?
What are some limitations of Inheritance in OOPS?
Explain Method Overriding in OOPS.
What is Operator Overloading? Explain with an example.
What are access specifiers?
What is an abstract class?
What are virtual functions in OOPs?
Explain the differences between Interfaces and Abstract Classes.
Explain Exception handling with an example.

Explain the try-catch block with an example.
Let's take a really simple example, let's say in a dataframe if one feature's value is simply the division of two other features. Feature C = Feature A / Feature B. We can just run the code, but division by zero could lead us into a error: in Python this is ZeroDivisionError. Thus, while performing this, if instead we use a try-catch block, as in try dividing and if it's not possible just store 0 as the solution it would be a better option.
